  "course_description": "This semester students are asked to transform the Hereshoff Museum in Bristol, Rhode Island, through processes of erasure and addition.\u00a0Hereshoff Manufacturing was recognized as one of the premier builders of America's Cup racing boats between 1890's and 1930's. The studio, however, is about more than the program.\u00a0It is about land, water, and wind and the search for expressing materially and tectonically the relationships between these principle conditions. That is, where the land is primarily about stasis (docking, anchoring and referencing our locus), water's fluidity holds the latent promise of movement and freedom.\u00a0Movement is activated by wind, allowing for negotiating the relationship between water and land.\n",
